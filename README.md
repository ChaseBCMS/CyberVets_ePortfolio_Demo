# CyberVets_ePortfolio_Demo
This is a demo site used to show CVs how their ePortfolios could be organized using GitHub.

Welcome to the CyberVets_ePortfolio_Demo wiki!

The wiki feature is perfect for your 'reflective journal'. Not only can you easily type your journal entries here, but you can also import links, and embed images here if needed.

Here are a few ideas to get you started:

Start your wiki with an initial page that introduces yourself and describes how you plan to use the wiki as the location of your reflective journal.
Use the ePortfolio TOC file to help you determine what entries you might consider including in your reflective journal.
Date your entries and title them with key words so that you can easily find specific entries as needed.
Writing a reflective journal is a practice that has a huge WIIFM factor! The benefits are commensurate with the effort put into developing it. Enjoy the process!

If you have questions or concerns, reach out to anyone on the CyberVets Admin Team!
